During	the	2011‐13	academic years,	81	of	Ohio’s	Local	Educational	Agencies	(LEAs)	 received	mini‐grants	to	implement	extended	testing	and	received value‐added	data	in	selected	grades	and	content	areas	not	covered	by	the	Ohio	Achievement	Assessments. An	OERC	research	team	developed	a	two	year	research	plan	to	evaluate	the	following broad	areas	regarding	Year	1	(Round	1)	and	Year	2	(Round	2)	mini‐grant	recipients:	

- Implementation. Identify	successes	and	areas	in	need	of	improvement, including	the	“buy‐in”	of	teachers. 
- Roster Veriϔication. Investigate	experiences	related	to	linking	students	to	the	teacher	of	record	with	the	appropriate	percentage	of	time. 
- Educator Evaluation Systems. Determine	how	the	data	from	the	extended testing	will	be	used	to	inform	OPES	and	OTES,	including	the	relationship between	the	teacher	performance	standards	component	and	expanded value‐added	metrics,	and	the	impact	on	instructional	practice	decisions. 
- LEA Solutions. Identify	implementation	practices	LEAs	have	adopted.
