This project was a fascinating two-year research effort addressing postsecondary education access and completion for students from the 29 Appalachian Ohio counties. Appalachian Ohio is of particular importance for research that informs education policy, as the region has historically had a lower college going rate, a less educated workforce, and a higher rate of poverty and overall unemployment than the rest of the state. A series of reports were generated from primary and secondary data, and these reports can be found [here](https://www.ohio.edu/education/centers-and-partnerships/centers/center-for-higher-education/projects-and-collaboratives/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=2149260), [here](http://www.oache.org/downloads/Executive%20Summary%20(2009)-981891860-1.pdf), and [here](https://www.ohio.edu/education/centers-and-partnerships/centers/center-for-higher-education/projects-and-collaboratives/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=2149261),
