The 2017 Health Value Dashboard is based on the Pathway to Health Value conceptual framework developed by Ohio stakeholders who participated on HPIO’s multi-sector Health Measurement Advisory Group (HMAG). The framework defines health value as the combination of improved population health outcomes and sustainable healthcare spending, and outlines the systems and environments that affect health. The 2017 Health Value Dashboard builds on the inaugural Dashboard released in December 2014.
