As part of the Excellent Educators for All Initiative led by the U.S. Department of Education, this plan meets Ohioâ€™s requirement to develop a State Plan to Ensure Equitable Access to Excellent Educators. The purpose of the state plans is to work toward ensuring that poor and minority children are not taught by unqualified, inexperienced or out-of-field teachers at higher rates than other children. Our study was carried out under contract with the Ohio Department of Education in 2017, with the express purpose of determining the extent to which the equity plan was working in Ohio, and where there was notable variance, the likely fault-lines of this variance (rural versus big urban districts, for example, and other factors).
