The CANS level of care pilot program included 11 counties, selected by ODJFS, and began using the tool beginning in March, 2015. As outlined in Sections 610.20 and 610.21 of the Amended Sub. H.B. 483 passed by the 130th Ohio General Assembly, the pilot was to end no later than 18 months after the date the pilot program began but data collection ran beyond  the initial closing date. The goal of the evaluation was to determine to what extent the Child Placement Level of Care Tool improves placement stability, length of stay and costs related to the length of stay, appropriateness of placement, and worker satisfaction. A copy of the final reort submitted to the Ohio Department of Jobs and Familr services is available  upon request.
