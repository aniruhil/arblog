<p>Elizabeth Hawley, the quintessential chronicler of mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas passed away today in Kathmandu, Nepal. One quote stands above the rest. In <a href="http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/11/i-frighten-a-lot-of-people-everest-chronicler-elizabeth-hawley-92-tells-it-like-it-is/">an interview</a> she said, when asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Interviewer: How do you want to be remembered? Do you have any thoughts about that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>EH: No, I’ve never thought about being remembered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“However, the meticulous chronicler’s name will live on. A mountain in north-west Nepal, bordering Tibet, was named Peak Hawley in her honour in 2014.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/obituaries/elizabeth-hawley-who-chronicled-everest-treks-dies-at-94.html">New York Times</a> has a touching piece on her life and passing but I would also recommend <a href="http://www.himalayandatabase.com/hawleybio.html">I’ll Call You in Kathmandu</a>. Courage she had in spades, as much as any who summitted Mt. Everest perhaps.</p>
