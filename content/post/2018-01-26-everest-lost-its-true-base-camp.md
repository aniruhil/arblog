Elizabeth Hawley, the quintessential chronicler of mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas passed away today in Kathmandu, Nepal. One quote stands above the rest. In [an interview](http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/11/i-frighten-a-lot-of-people-everest-chronicler-elizabeth-hawley-92-tells-it-like-it-is/) she said, when asked: 

> "Interviewer: How do you want to be remembered? Do you have any thoughts about that?

> EH: No, Iâ€™ve never thought about being remembered. 

"However, the meticulous chronicler's name will live on. A mountain in north-west Nepal, bordering Tibet, was named Peak Hawley in her honour in 2014."

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/obituaries/elizabeth-hawley-who-chronicled-everest-treks-dies-at-94.html) has a touching piece on her life and passing but I would also recommend [I'll Call You in Kathmandu](http://www.himalayandatabase.com/hawleybio.html). Courage she had in spades, as much as any who summitted Mt. Everest perhaps.
