East is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet!

Nah, that might happen sooner than I can get this working. 

```{r diamonds, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.cap="Just another plot", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_hex() + scale_fill_viridis()
```

So here we are, two days and progress but slow going. I should have remembered that the Hilary Step had broken.
