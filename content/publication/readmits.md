abstract = "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) decreases cardiac morbidity and mortality, but the effect on hospital readmission is not clear. We identified patients with AMI and/or PCI from 2008-2009 Medicare claims data for the Columbus, OH hospital referral cluster (8,365 patients, 35 counties), and used a propensity-score model to match 748 CR participants and 3,804 non-participants on baseline characteristics. CR participants had lower 90-day risk of rehospitalization, with benefits seen only in the CR exposure period. Improved care transition systems to increase and speed CR enrollment may reduce rehospitalization rates."
