## Agenda 

Understanding how to work with dates and times with 

- using `base R` 
- using `lubridate` 

---

Start by creating some data values.  


```r
basedate = as.Date("1970-1-1")
today = Sys.Date()
tomorrow = as.Date("2017-12-18")
yesterday1 = "12/16/2017"
yesterday2 = "12-16-17"
yesterday3 = "12 16 17"
```

How did R read these? 


```r
str(list(basedate, today, tomorrow, yesterday1, yesterday2, yesterday3))
```

```
## List of 6
##  $ : Date[1:1], format: "1970-01-01"
##  $ : Date[1:1], format: "2018-02-08"
##  $ : Date[1:1], format: "2017-12-18"
##  $ : chr "12/16/2017"
##  $ : chr "12-16-17"
##  $ : chr "12 16 17"
```

Some are dates some are characters `(chr)` 

---

We can flip the characters into dates 


```r
yesterday1d = as.Date(yesterday1, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
yesterday2d = as.Date(yesterday2, format = "%m-%d-%y")
yesterday3d = as.Date(yesterday3, format = "%m %d %y")
yesterday1d
```

```
## [1] "2017-12-16"
```

```r
yesterday2d
```

```
## [1] "2017-12-16"
```

```r
yesterday3d
```

```
## [1] "2017-12-16"
```

---

There are special switches that indicate date components when you `format = ""`

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Code &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Represents &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Example &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %a &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Day spelled out (abbreviated) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Mon &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %A &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Day spelled out &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Monday &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %d &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Day of the month &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 16 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %m &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Month &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 12 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %b &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Month (abbreviated) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Dec &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %B &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Month (fully spelled out) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; December &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %y &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Year (2-digits) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 17 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; %Y &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Year (4-digits) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 2017 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


---

So if you ever run into a date field that needs formatting, what we have covered should help you convert it into a proper date formatted variable.  

Once you convert them to the date format, you can extract other quantities. 


```r
weekdays(yesterday1d)
```

```
## [1] "Saturday"
```

```r
months(today)
```

```
## [1] "February"
```

```r
quarters(today)
```

```
## [1] "Q1"
```

---

Sometimes you will have a number representing the date, with the number representing the number of days since (if positive) or before (if negative) some date  of origin. R uses `1970-01-01` but other software packages may (and some do) use different days. Thus, for example, if the dates are listed as 


```r
x = c(17651, -2345, 19760)
```

Then these numbers represent the following dates: 


```r
x.dates = as.Date(x, origin = "1970-01-01")
x.dates
```

```
## [1] "2018-04-30" "1963-08-01" "2024-02-07"
```

You can also convert dates into the numbers representing dates. 


```r
x.julian = julian(x.dates, origin = as.POSIXct("1970-01-01", tz = "UCT"))
x.julian
```

```
## [1] 17651 -2345 19760
## attr(,"origin")
## [1] "1970-01-01 UCT"
```

What if I wanted to create a sequence of dates, starting with Feb 8, 2018 but increasing by 1 day at a time or by every 5th day? 


```r
start.date = as.Date(as.character("2018-02-08"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")
date.seq1 = seq(start.date, by = 1, length.out = 7)
date.seq1
```

```
## [1] "2018-02-08" "2018-02-09" "2018-02-10" "2018-02-11" "2018-02-12"
## [6] "2018-02-13" "2018-02-14"
```

```r
date.seq5 = seq(start.date, by = 5, length.out = 3)
date.seq5
```

```
## [1] "2018-02-08" "2018-02-13" "2018-02-18"
```

Note that `length.out =` is specifying how many you dates want to create. 

---

Now, what if I want to know the date 30 days from today? 19 days ago? 


```r
date.30 = today + 30
date.19 = today - 19
```

How many days lapsed between two dates? 


```r
date1 = as.Date("2017-04-28")
date2 = Sys.Date()
lapsed.time = date2 - date1
lapsed.time
```

```
## Time difference of 286 days
```

Say I want to create a vector of dates that starts and ends on specific dates, and the step function is 1 day, a week, 4 months, etc. The step is indicated with the `by = ""` command 


```r
my.dates1 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "day")
my.dates2 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "week")
my.dates3 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "month")
my.dates4 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "3 days")
my.dates5 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "2 weeks")
my.dates6 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2018-12-16"), by = "4 months")
my.dates7 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2019-12-16"), by = "year")
my.dates8 = seq(from = as.Date("2017-12-17"), to = as.Date("2022-12-16"), by = "2 years")
```

This package makes working with dates and times quite easy because it does what base R does but in more intuitive ways and perhaps more flexibly. Let us start with some date fields.


```r
today1 = "20171217"
today2 = "2017-12-17"
today3 = "2017 December 17"
today4 = "20171217143241"
today5 = "2017 December 17 14:32:41"
today6 = "December 17 2017 14:32:41"
today7 = "17-Dec, 2017 14:32:41"
```

The formats are quite varied but `lubridate` deals with them quite seamlessly so long as you pay attention to the order -- is year first or last? What about month? day? Is time given in hours, minutes and seconds?.

If I need to extract data/time elements, I can do that as well. 


```r
today = dmy_hms(today7)
today  # a date and time set in today7 
```

```
## [1] "2017-12-17 14:32:41 UTC"
```

```r
today.y = year(today)
today.y  # The year 
```

```
## [1] 2017
```

```r
today.m1 = month(today)
today.m1  # the month, as a number  
```

```
## [1] 12
```

```r
today.m2 = month(today, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
today.m2  # labeling the month but with an abbreviation 
```

```
## [1] Dec
## 12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec
```

```r
today.m3 = month(today, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
today.m3  # fully labelling the month 
```

```
## [1] December
## 12 Levels: January &lt; February &lt; March &lt; April &lt; May &lt; June &lt; ... &lt; December
```

today.doy  # what day of the year is it?
