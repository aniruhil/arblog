## Agenda 

- Install R and RStudio
- Test installation
- Install some packages 
- Understand how R Markdown works 
- Read data in various formats 
- Basic data processing and saving 

---

## Installing R and RStudio 

First install the latest version of ![](./images/Rsvgsm.png) from [here](https://cloud.r-project.org) 

Then install the latest version of ![](./images/Rstudiosm.png) from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Launch RStudio and check that it shows 

&gt; R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30) -- "Kite-Eating Tree"  
Copyright (C) 2017 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing

???
- Go slow and make sure everyone is able to knit 
- Minimize panic and keep the environment light 

---

## Understand your RStudio Environment 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/rstudiopanes.png", width = 600px&gt;&lt;/content&gt;


???
(1) The Console ...
(2) Knitting and [Code Chunk options](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) 

---

## Installing packages 

Open the Rmd file I sent you: **Module01.Rmd** and save it in the **code** folder 
Save the data I sent you to the **data** folder

Now we install some packages via `Tools -&gt; Install Packages...` and updated packages via `Tools -&gt; Check for Package Updates...`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


```r
devtools, ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, lubridate, car, Hmisc, gapminder, leaflet, prettydoc, DT, data.table, htmltools, scales, ggridges
```

Other packages will be installed as needed 

.footnote[[1] It is a good idea to update packages on a regular frequency but every now and then something might break with an update but it is usually fixed sooner rather than later by the developer.]

???
- Make sure they install `devtools`

---

## Working directory versus Rprojects 
- Start by finding your current working directory; type `getwd()`  at the `&gt;` prompt in the `Console` and see the result 
- Now create a folder called **mpa6020**  to store everything you will read, develop, etc. in this course 
- Inside **mpa6020** create two sub-folders called **code** and **data**, respectively. The  folder structure will now be 


```r
mpa6020
--code
--data
```

- Now create a `project` via `File -&gt; New Project`, choose `Existing Directory`, &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/projects.png", width = 300px&gt;&lt;/center&gt; and browse to the  **mpa6020** folder  
- RStudio will restart and you will be in the project folder, seeing a file called `mpa6020.Rproj`

???
- Point out that every time they start working they can click on `mpa6020.Rproj` and everything should work seamlessly unless something breaks 

---

## R Markdown files

- Go to `New File -&gt; R Markdown ...` and enter a `My First Rmd File` in title and your `name`. 

&lt;img src="./images/Rmd.png" width="280" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

-  Click `OK`. 
- Now `File -&gt; Save As..` and save it as `testing_rmd` in the **code** sub-folder
- Click this button: ![](./images/knit.png)  
&gt; You may see a message that says some packages need to be installed/updated. Allow these to be installed/updated. 

???
- Emphasize the importance of the YAML `YAML Ain't Markup Language`
- Urge patience again since some packages may have to be installed more than once, perhaps via `devtools`, and some may not have admin rights (the horror, the horror!!)
- Show them how to knit to Word and to PDF  
- Tell them you will show them how to generate a slide-deck later, if anyone is interested 

---

.pull-left[
... if all goes well ...

&lt;img src="./images/img01.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

As the document knits, watch for error messages 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/simpsons.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
]

---

## Reading data

Make sure you have the following data-sets in the **data** folder. If you don't then the commands that follow will not work. We start by reading a simple `comma-separated variable` format file and then a `tab-delimited variable` format file. 


```r
df.csv = read.csv("./data/ImportDataCSV.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)  # note sep = ','
df.tab = read.csv("./data/ImportDataTAB.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)  # note sep = '\t'
```

If the files were read then `Environment` should show objects called `df.csv` and `df.tab`. If you don't see these then check the following: 
- Make sure you have the files in your **data** folder 
- Make sure the folder has been correctly named (no blank spaces before or after, all lowercase, etc)
- Make sure the data folder is inside **mpa6020**  

???
- Point out the importance of setting the data path to `./data/filename.ext` 

---

(a) **Excel** files can be read via the `readxl` package


```r
library(readxl)
df.xls = read_excel("./data/ImportDataXLS.xls")
df.xlsx = read_excel("./data/ImportDataXLSX.xlsx")
```

(b) **SPSS, Stata, SAS** files can be read via the `haven` package


```r
library(haven)
df.stata = read_stata("./data/ImportDataStata.dta")
df.sas = read_sas("./data/ImportDataSAS.sas7bdat")
df.spss = read_sav("./data/ImportDataSPSS.sav")
```

(c) It is also common to encounter **fixed-width** files where the raw data are stored without any gaps between successive variables. However, these files will come with documentation that will tell you where each variable starts and ends, along with other details about each variable. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/fwftxt.png", width = 200px&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


```r
df.fw = read.fwf("./data/fwfdata.txt", widths = c(4, 9, 2, 4), header = FALSE, 
    col.names = c("Name", "Month", "Day", "Year"))
```

Notice we need `widths = c()` and `col.names = c()`. We will wrestle with some fixed-width files in the coming weeks.  

---

## Reading Files from the Web

It is possible to specify the full web-path for a file and read it in, rather than storing a local copy. This is often useful when  updated by the source (Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor, Bureau of Economic Analysis, etc.) 


```r
fpe = read.table("http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/effort.dat")
test = read.table("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/test.txt", 
    header = TRUE)
test.csv = read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/test.csv", 
    header = TRUE)

library(foreign)
hsb2.spss = read.spss("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsb2.sav")
df.hsb2.spss = as.data.frame(hsb2.spss)
```

`hsb2.spss` was read with the `foreign` package&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an alternative to `haven` 
- `foreign` calls `read.spss` 
- `haven` calls `read_spss`

.footnote[[2] The `foreign` package will also read Stata and other formats. I end up defaulting to `haven` now. There are other packages for reading SPSS, SAS, etc. files ... `sas7bdat`, `rio`, `data.table`, `xlsx`, `XLConnect`, `gdata` and others. 
]

???

- Point out that they must have an internet connection or else the file won't be read 
- Remind them that if the source file's URL change the file may not be read, but it is easy to check if a broken URL is the source of the error by using a browser 

---

## Reading compressed files 


```r
temp = tempfile()
download.file("ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/
              Datasets/NVSS/bridgepop/2016/pcen_v2016_y1016.sas7bdat.zip", 
    temp)
oursasdata = haven::read_sas(unz(temp, "pcen_v2016_y1016.sas7bdat"))
unlink(temp)
```

You can save your data in a format that R will recognize, giving it the **RData** or **rdata** extension 


```r
save(oursasdata, file = "./data/oursasdata.RData")
save(oursasdata, file = "./data/oursasdata.rdata")
```

Check your **data** directory to confirm both files are present 

---
 
## Minimal example of data processing

Working with the **hsb2** data: 200 students from the High school and Beyond study 


```r
hsb2 = read.table("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsb2.csv", 
    header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

- female  = (0/1) 
- race = (1=hispanic 2=asian 3=african-amer 4=white) 
- ses  = socioeconomic status (1=low 2=middle 3=high) 
- schtyp =  type of school (1=public 2=private) 
- prog   = type of program (1=general 2=academic 3=vocational) 
- read  =  standardized reading score 
- write  = standardized writing score 
- math   = standardized math score 
- science = standardized science score 
- socst = standardized social studies score

There are no label values for the various qualitative variables (female, race, ses, schtyp, and prog) so we create these.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 


```r
hsb2$female = factor(hsb2$female, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", 
    "Female"))
hsb2$race = factor(hsb2$race, levels = c(1:4), labels = c("Hispanic", 
    "Asian", "African American", "White"))
hsb2$ses = factor(hsb2$ses, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("Low", "Middle", 
    "High"))
hsb2$schtyp = factor(hsb2$schtyp, levels = c(1:2), labels = c("Public", 
    "Private"))
hsb2$prog = factor(hsb2$prog, levels = c(1:3), labels = c("General", 
    "Academic", "Vocational"))
```

.footnote[[3] This is just a quick run through with creating value labels; we will cover this in greater detail in a later module.

#### save your work!!

Having added labels to the factors in __hsb2__ we can now save the data for later use. 


```r
save(hsb2, file = "./data/hsb2.RData")
```

Let us test if this R Markdown file will ![](./images/knit.png) to html 

If all is good then we can `Close Project` 
- RStudio will close your project and reopen in a vanilla session 

???

- Help with any knitting problems 
- Remind them to save the Rmd before they `Close Project` 

---
## Data in packages 

Almost all R packages come bundled with data-sets, too many of them to walk you through but 
- [see here for standard ones](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) 
- [here are some more](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html) 
- [and some more](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/data_in_r_sortable.html) 

To load data from a package, if you know the data-set's name, run 


```r
library(HistData)
data("Galton")
names(Galton)
```

```
## [1] "parent" "child"
```

or you can run 


```r
data("GaltonFamilies", package = "HistData")
names(GaltonFamilies)
```

```
## [1] "family"          "father"          "mother"          "midparentHeight"
## [5] "children"        "childNum"        "gender"          "childHeight"
```


---
## Saving data and workspaces 

You can certainly save your data via 
  - `save(dataname, file = "filepath/filename.RData")` or 
  - `save(dataname, file = "filepath/filename.rdata")`


```r
data(mtcars)
save(mtcars, file = "./data/mtcars.RData")
* rm(list = ls()) # To clear the Environment
load("./data/mtcars.RData")
```

You can also save multiple data files as follows: 


```r
data(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
* save(mtcars, diamonds, file = "./data/mydata.RData") 
rm(list = ls()) # To clear the Environment
load("./data/mydata.RData")
```

---

If you want to save just a single `object` from the environment and then load it in a later session, maybe with a different name, then you should use `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()` 


```r
data(mtcars)
saveRDS(mtcars, file = "./data/mydata.RDS")
rm(list = ls())  # To clear the Environment
ourdata = readRDS("./data/mydata.RDS")
```

If instead you did the following, note that you have to did the following, the file  will be read with the name when saved 


```r
data(mtcars)
save(mtcars, file = "./data/mtcars.RData")
rm(list = ls())  # To clear the Environment
ourdata = load("./data/mtcars.RData")  # Note ourdata is listed as 'mtcars' 
```

If you want to save everything you have done in the work session you can via `save.image()` 


```r
save.image(file = "mywork_jan182018.RData")
```
- The next time you start RStudio this image will be automatically loaded 
- Useful if you have a lot of R code you have written and various objects generated and do not want to start from scratch the next time around. 

???

Let them know that if not in a project and they try to close RStudio after some code has been run, they will be prompted to save (or not) the  `workspace` and they should say "no"

# Exercises for practice 

![](./images/jerrysarcasm.gif)
---
#### Ex. 1: Creating and knitting a new RMarkdown file

Open a fresh session by launching RStudio and then running `File -&gt; Open Project...`  

Give it a title, your name as the author, and then save it with in **code** with the following name:  `m1ex1.Rmd`  

Delete all content after the following code chunk  

&lt;img src="./images/dchunk.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Add this level 1 heading `The Starwars Data` and then insert your first code chunk *exactly as shown below* 


```r
library(dplyr)
data(starwars)
str(starwars)
```

Add this level 2 heading `Character  Heights and Weights` and then your second code chunk 


```r
plot(starwars$height, plot$mass)
```

Now knit this file to **html** 


---

#### Ex. 2: Lorem Ipsum paragraphs and graphs 

Go to [this website](https://loremipsumgenerator.com/generator/?n=2&amp;t=p) and generate five Lorem Ipsum placeholder text paragraphs 
  - para 1: must have level 1 heading 
  - para 2: must have level 2 heading 
  - para 3: must have level 3 heading 
  - para 4: must have level 4 heading 
  - para 5: must have level 5 heading 

Using the `starwars` data, create five code chunks, one after each paragraph 
  - Each code chunk will have the same R code (see below)


```r
plot(starwars$height, plot$mass)
```

Now knit this file to **html** 

---
#### Ex. 3: Reading in three data files 

Create a new `RMarkdown` file that is blank after the `initial setup code chunk` 

Insert a code chunk that reads in both these files found on the web 
- `http://www.stata.com/data/jwooldridge/eacsap/mroz.dta` 
- `http://calcnet.mth.cmich.edu/org/spss/V16_materials/DataSets_v16/airline_passengers.sav` 

In a follow-up code chunk, run the `summary()` command on each data-set 

In a separate code chunk, read in [this dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201502-citibike-tripdata.zip) after you download it and save the unzipped file in your **data** folder. 
- The variable `gender` has the following codes: `Zero = unknown; 1 = male; 2 = female` 
- Use this coding scheme to convert `gender` into a `factor` with these value labels 

In a follow-up chunk run both the following commands on this data-set 
- `names()` 
- `str()` 
- `summary()` 

In a final chunk, run the commands necessary to save each of the three data-sets as separate `RData` files. Make sure you save them in your **data** folder. 

Now knit the complete `Rmd` file to **html** 

---

#### Ex. 4: Knitting with prettydoc 

I'd like you to use a specific Rmd because these are very readable 

You had installed the `prettydoc` package so now create a prettydoc Rmd file as shown below: 

.pull-left[
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/prettydoc1.png", width = 300px&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
]
.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src = "./images/prettydoc2.png", width = 280px&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
]


Now take all the text and code chunk you created in Ex. 3 and insert it in this file. Make sure you add a title, etc in the `YAML` and then knit the file to `html` 

You can play with the `theme:` and `highlight:` fields, choosing from the options [displayed here](http://yixuan.cos.name/prettydoc/themes.html)

To see native R Markdown formatting options [read the documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#overview) 

???

- Point out that the native Rmd formats allow for a lot more options than does the prettydoc format 
- Initial files I provide will be prettydoc because of their simplicity but later formats will rely on more flexible Rmd formats
